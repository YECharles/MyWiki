# Software Release Life Cycle #

Pre-alpha  ->  Alpha  ->  Beta  ->  RC  ->  RTM  -> GA  ->  Production  ->  Support  ->  End-of-life

|<-- Dev -->|<-------- Testing -------->|<---------- Release --------->|<-- Support -->|<-- End  -->|


## Development period  ##

* Pre-alpha: Pre-alpha refers to all activities performed during the software project before testing. These activities can include requirements analysis, software design, software development, and unit testing.


## Testing period ##

* Alpha(内测): The alpha phase of the release life cycle is the first phase to begin software testing. In this phase, developers generally test the software using white-box techniques. Additional validation is then performed using black-box or gray-box techniques, by another testing team. Alpha software may not contain all of the features that are planned for the final version. The alpha phase usually ends with a feature freeze, indicating that no more features will be added to the software. At this time, the software is said to be feature complete.
* Beta(公测): Beta, named after the second letter of the Greek alphabet, is the software development phase following alpha. Software in the beta stage is also known as betaware.Beta phase generally begins when the software is feature complete but likely to contain a number of known or unknown bugs.The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release and this is typically the first time that the software is available outside of the organization that developed it. 
* Release Candidate(RC): Also aka gamma/delta. A release candidate (RC) is a beta version with potential to be a final product, which is ready to release unless significant bugs emerge. In this stage of product stabilization, all product features have been designed, coded and tested through one or more beta cycles with no known showstopper-class bugs.


## Release period ##

* Release to manufacturing/marketing (RTM)/Release to web (RTW): The term "release to manufacturing/marketing", also known as "going gold", is a term used when a software product is ready to be delivered or provided to the customer. Release to web (RTW) or web release is a means of software delivery that utilizes the Internet for distribution.
* General availability (GA): General availability (GA) is the marketing stage at which all necessary commercialization activities have been completed and a software product is available for purchase, depending, however, on language, region, electronic vs. media availability.
* Production or live release: aka Gold. 


## Others ##

* Support
* End-of-life
